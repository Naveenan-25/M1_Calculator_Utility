#REQUIREMENTS:
#INTRODUCTION:The calculator project is the application based mini project, which is used to predict the by taking input 
user. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach (Linux and Windows).

#RESEARCH
People who don’t have technical knowledge for calculation can use this application to perform various operation based on the user's 
choice such as addition, subraction, multiplication, division, etc. However defining a calculator generally includes:

1.Adiition

2.Subraction

3.Multilication 

4.Division 

Advanced calculator generally includes:

1.Modulus

2.Factorial

3.Power

4.Logvalue

#Defining System:

Design and testing operations of calcualtor using unit testing algorithm.

#SWOT analysis:

Strengths: User-friendly.

Weakness: As the 

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. We can overcome this method by using the calculator.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.

#4’W and 1’H


What: Calculator

Where: School, Science, domestic, industries, Technology, Banking sectors.

When: Need for calculation.

How: Calculates the user input and gives the output:
