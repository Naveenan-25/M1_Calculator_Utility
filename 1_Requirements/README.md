# REQUIREMENTS:
#INTRODUCTION:The calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. And also the complex operations such as modulus, factorial of the number, finding the power, squareroot of the given number, log value of the number.   

# RESEARCH
Generally, many people in the various feilds are based on the calculator for their daily activities. people who don’t have technical knowledge for calculation can use this application to perform various operation based on the user's choice such as addition, subraction, multiplication, division, etc. 

Basic operation calculator generally includes:

1.Addition

2.Subraction

3.Multilication 

4.Division 

Advanced calculator generally includes:

1.Modulus

2.Factorial

3.Power

4.Logvalue

#Defining System:

Design and testing operations of calcualtor using unit testing algorithm.

# SWOT analysis:

Strengths: User-friendly, perform complex operations, less time consumement.

Weakness: As the features of the calculator decrease then the cost of the calculator decrease.

Opportunities: Most of the calculations are done using pen and paper. We can overcome this method by using the calculator.

Threats: Some limits has been there for the most complex problems which the calculator can't do.

# 4’W and 1’H

Who: Anyone who needs the use of calculator like students, teachers, banks.

What: Calculator Application.

Where: School, Science, industries, Banking sectors.

When: Need for calculation.

How: Calculates the user input and gives the output.
