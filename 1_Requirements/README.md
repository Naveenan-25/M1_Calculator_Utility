#REQUIREMENTS

#INTRODUCTION: 
The calculator is the application which is used to perform many operations as user's input such as addition of to numbers, subraction, multiplication ,division etc. The tool which we used to write the code in the project is visual studio. This project has multifile and multiplatform approach.

#RESEARCH:
People who don't have technical knowledge of simple and complex calculations can use this appliction for developing their knowledge by predicting the correct output. However, the defining features of calculator includes:
1.Addition
2.Subraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division

In addition the advanced calculator includes
1.Modulus
2.Factorial
3.Log value
4.Power
