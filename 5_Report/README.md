#Project Goal

Project entitled Calculator aims is to perform various operations as user's input. Manual calculation which is very difficult for complex probelms. To overcome this issue we can use this calculator. The aim of this project is to develop a system that is meant to partially computerize the work performed in the banking sectors, and other sectors where the calculation is more effficiently used. To reduce the time and man power we can use this application. We used Microsoft Visual Basic for developing our project. Visual Basic is primarily a visual design environment. We can create a VB application by designing the form and that make up the user interface. Adding visual basic application code to the form and the objects such as buttons and text boxes on them and adding any required support code in additional modular.

#Advantages

By using the calculator we can save the time required to calculate the output for the complex probelms. The overall project report is divided into some parts. These parts are further divided into their subparts. In the parts we have described the purpose, scope of the project, objective of the project i.e. approach which used for developing this software. It includes the topics like the problems with the existing system and the functionality of the organization. Introduction to tools, design, coding, testing and debugging of the system are discussed in very detail.

#Conclusion

This project is to understand the concepts of file handling and for understanding the concepts of C Programming language. By the completion of this project now I can know how to make a project in a industrial manner. I have completed all the necessary project structure format and submitted in GitHub Repository and executed the code successfully.
