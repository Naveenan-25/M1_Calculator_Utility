# PROJECT_GOALS

* The main objective of the calculator is to perform a number of calculations in response to user supplied input. TThe possible number of calculations is pre-defined. The results of the calculations may be presented in summary or detailed format. It is these outputs that are the main business functions of the calculator. The calculation and results are displayed in the output page.

# ADVANTAGES

* By using the calculator we can save the time required to calculate the output for the complex probelms. The major use of the calculator is to reduce the user time taken to complete the complex problems. And also calculator plays the major role in the banking sectors where the calculation and other operations are required. Many people have used paper works for their calculation, for complex proelms it is very difficult hence we use this calculator for reducing those difficulties.

# DISADVANTAGES

* There is some limit for a calculator in which it cannot solve all kinds of complex probelms like divisible by zero conditions. Beyond certain limits the expected output will be error, and hence the following output will be changed. This is the main disadvantages of the calculator.   


# CONCLUSION

* Finally I conclude that using the C programing we can build a calculator which performs the basic operations and complex operations. I have learned to make our code more efficient and also works under any kind situation. The concepts of C program which I have used in the code is very understandable and userfriendly, from this project I gained many experience related to industrial structure that how should the project should be started and ended in industrial and civilized manner.
